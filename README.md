Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Purple-Hat-Bot is a modern, intelligent cybersecurity tool built for real-time threat monitoring, detection, and alerting. It combines a powerful interactive command-line interface with automated threat detection and instant Telegram notifications.

Designed with a focus on modularity and performance, this bot empowers system administrators, DevOps teams, and security professionals with the tools to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.

**Features**

**üîí Real-Time Cyber Threat Detection**
Leverages `scapy` for deep packet inspection and a multi-threaded engine to analyze network traffic for threats like DoS attacks, port scans, and HTTP floods in real time.

**‚öôÔ∏è Interactive Command-Line Interface**
A rich, color-coded CLI to manage monitoring, run network diagnostics, configure settings, and view threat reports.

**üí° Purple Team Tactics**
Combines offensive simulation tools with defensive monitoring capabilities, allowing you to test your defenses and respond effectively.

**üìä Comprehensive Threat Reporting**
Detected threats are logged, displayed in formatted tables, and can be exported to Telegram on-demand for a quick security overview.

**üîî Instant Telegram Alerts**
Configure your Telegram bot token and chat ID to receive immediate, detailed alerts the moment a threat is detected.

**üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases**

- **Monitoring:** Actively monitor one or more specific IPs on your network for malicious activity.
- **Diagnostics:** Quickly run network diagnostics like `ping`, `scan`, `tracert`, and `netstat` directly from the tool.
- **Threat Simulation:** Generate test traffic (`portscan`, `dos`, `httpflood`) to validate detection rules and response times.
- **Education:** A hands-on tool for learning about network defense and packet analysis.

**üì¶ Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Accurate-Cyber-Defense/Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Purple-Hat-Bot.git

**modification log**
 -Successfully broke the project across files
 -Made the config fetched from the config file 
 -Made a propper requirements.txt because the installation called for one but there wasent one.
 -Optimized it for expandability and modularity
 -This Pullrequest IS SUPPOSED TO BE modified to fit the tool correctly
 -Spent way to long optimizing things im to lazy to list.. it tbh just felt like 99.99% ai with how many things didnt line up, no offense
 -i kinda stopped logging what i was doing because i had to change a bit...
